# Cohesion and Coupling

Implementing a Vehicle Registry by identifying the difference between cohesion and coupling.
This repository is heavily inspired by [ArjanCodes's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiDyK_ofPPM).

1. Cohesion - represents a degree of **relationship** between classes, functions, or modules

2. Coupling - represents a degree of **dependence** of a class, function, or module on another.
